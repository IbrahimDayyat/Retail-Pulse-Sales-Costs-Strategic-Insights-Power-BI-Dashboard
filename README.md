# Retail-Pulse-Sales-Costs-Strategic-Insights-Power-BI-Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard analyzing retail performance, revealed Clothing (33% of sales) as the top driver and Electronics (12%) as underperforming. Identified rising costs (+20% rent/wages) and optimized CORE store efficiency. Enabled data-driven strategies for cost control and revenue growth.

##Project Details:

#Objective:

Uncover actionable insights into retail sales, costs, and departmental performance to drive strategic decision-making.

##Key Contributions:

#Data Gathering, Cleaning & Validation:

Connect data files from different sources (Excel and CSV). Part of the Corporate Finance Institute Specialization.  

Validated totals to ensure accuracy (e.g., $4.05B sales aligned across metrics).

#Interactive Dashboards:

Built 3 interconnected dashboards tracking sales KPIs, costs, and departmental/store-type performance.

Designed drill-downs for time trends (2020–2022) and department-store linkages.

#DAX Formulas & Calculations:

Created metrics like Sales per $1 Rent and Cumulative Difference from Target.

Automated YoY growth calculations for cost and sales trends.

##Technical Execution:

#Visualizations:

Matrix visuals comparing department performance across store types (CORE, DIGITAL, LOCAL).

Scatter plots to correlate rent/wages with sales efficiency.

Time-series charts with moving averages to highlight trends.

#Root-Cause Analysis:

Identified Nevada as a critical underperformer (-$82M gap) through geographic and departmental filters.

Linked stagnant sales growth (+0% since 2020) to rising operational costs.

##Insights & Impact:

#Strategic Recommendations:

Redirected marketing budgets to the Clothing and Kitchen departments.

Proposed cost audits for high-rent stores (e.g., Arizona, Texas).

Suggested bundling Electronics with Clothing to boost cross-selling.

#Business Impact:

Highlighted $240M aggregate overperformance against targets.

Prioritized closure/reallocation of underperforming DIGITAL/LOCAL stores.

##Tools & Technologies:

Power BI | DAX | Data Modeling | Excel | Strategic Storytelling




##Why It Stands Out:
Combined technical rigor (DAX, data cleaning) with business acumen to turn raw data into a retail strategy roadmap. Perfect for showcasing analytical and problem-solving skills!
